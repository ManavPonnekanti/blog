title: About

I'm a medical student at UCL interested in the eyes, the brain, and computational methods that help us better understand their function. I am currently training large language models on GAD-7 and PHQ-9 responses in an effort to surface clinically useful latent factors that influence self-report at the [Applied Computational Psychiatry Lab](https://acplab.org/).

In my free time I run a book club, which you can find out more about [here](/book-club).

A goal of this site is to be as fast, legible, and widely supported as possible. This means semantic HTML, no JavaScript, and minimal CSS. It also uses an [instant.page](https://instant.page) script to improve load-times. Thank you for visiting!
