# Min-maxing quality of life enhancements

I’ve wasted far too much of my youth on niche subreddits, thinking that I’m very cool for developing discernment in mundane and ordinary things. Much of this was a waste of time. I’ve come to believe that for each respective QoL enhancement there is an optimal level of engagement at which you reap pretty much all of the benefit, and any further cognitive energy and money you funnel into it is just chasing a nonexistent white whale.

In an effort to make those hundreds of hours worth something, below is a list of the various niches I’ve become obsessed with over the years and associated product(s) which I think represent the pragmatic peak. Go no further, just buy it and enjoy it and do more useful things with your time.

This list is by its nature opinionated, so discretion advised etc etc. Prices are as of March 2024. Items are not linked because Amazon tends to have a lot of link rot and it’s often cheaper to buy this sort of thing from smaller specialty online stores (and I’m lazy). Maybe at some point I’ll update this with a list of good vendors.

### Coffee
- Get a *Clever dripper* ($35) and as good of a grinder as you can afford
  - Follow [these instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpOdennxP24) to brew with it
- Hand-crank grinders generally have the best bang-for-buck in terms of quality of grind to price
  - Cheapest acceptable hand-grinder is the *Hario Skerton* ($35), decent mid-range is the *Timemore C2* ($60), high-end is *1zpresso JX Pro* ($140), beyond this it’s diminishing returns
- Get medium-dark roasted “house blends” from online home-delivery roasters
  - They are cheaper than single-origin, forgiving to brew with, and taste like an upgrade to familiar coffee instead of an entirely new sour and fruity beverage à la Blue Bottle
### Tea
- All you need if you’re making tea for yourself is a generic *cup infuser* (<$10)
  - [Here](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-BREW-Tea-Infuser-Basket/dp/B07GF4WYGT/ref=sr_1_4?crid=XI8DN97DH3UT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8lgCA83o3K-GNzniLr7x_J1Qe4YtQRR0Lw7019weY0SlipHPOn0XjWVvnF8YbxScfIE1rz7c1CgJzdlR05Gpv2zwTRTIr0rm6dqgR6lRTsEBM1IrPBUemojvQv6BkmCXXusiGflSHrGuWOslFLi2MGnuCiWJLMKZG9ToWBY7je6ISgNnYxPY40stM7GNCOJSb04de0V3iDvmVAWtmU4c0nPzaDt-Tkji8IpEM3-MXS1BqAiGhR1b_sSctZ_hVYFX0DB6rjXtE5qYk2KFbLyTl0ap_5wYvDx5hw_WVR-gPUQ.TBV-b0MteaKkAzURG-I8dX90cbbLua1dvSfxYBwfdQA&dib_tag=se&keywords=tea+basket+brewer&qid=1711901793&sprefix=tea+basket+brewer%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-4) is a random example. Avoid those small ball infusers
- If you want to brew tea for two or more, a *french press* is preferable to a teapot
  - If you have one lying around, make sure to clean it thoroughly since tea is much lighter than coffee and any residue will spoil the taste
  - If you are buying new, you can’t go wrong with *Bodum*
- Try green teas, oolongs, and black teas to figure out what you like ($5-10 per 50g)
  - *Gyokuro* is a Japanese tea, and it is good representative for greens
    - These should be brewed at lower temperatures, around 80°C. Just leave your water off the head for 5 minutes
  - *Jin Xuan*, also known as ‘milk oolong’ is Chinese, and is worth trying for its naturally creamy flavour — no milk is actually used in the preparation process
    - Make sure you are not getting a flavoured variety
    - This can be brewed with boiling or near-boiling water
  - *Darjeeling* is a good representative for Indian black teas
    - Brew with boiling water
- For all of the above, use one teaspoon of tea per cup of water and brew for 3 minutes as a starting point
- Pick a vendor from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and you’ll probably end up with something good
- 
### Mechanical keyboards
- Anything from *Keychron* (~$100) that fits your preferred keyboard layout and size
- In terms of key switches:
  - Clicky (*Blue*) if you want something loud and mechanical-feeling, avoid if you are going to use in a communal space
  * Tactile (*Brown*) if you just want to type — middle of the road option
  - Linear (*Red/yellow*) if you are going to game on your computer
### Shaving
- *Merkur 34C* safety razor (~$40)
- *Arko shaving soap* (~5 dollars)— get the “in bowl” version and stick put the soap puck into the bottom of an old mug
- Any well-reviewed synthetic shaving brush on Amazon
- Get a *blade sampler pack* from somewhere like [here](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/collections/razor-blades-sample-packs)
  - Make sure to get one with *Personna* blades since they are gentle and a good way to learn without cutting yourself
  - You will probably end up wanting something more aggressive
  - Blades are a trial-and-error game
- Watch any youtube tutorial on how to use a double edged safety razor, they’re all the same
### Fountain pens
- *Platinum preppy* ($5) and some *Platinum Carbon Ink* cartridges are all you really need
- If you want something that look a bit more professional then the *Pilot Metropolitan* ($20) is good
- If you are intrepid and willing to hunt on eBay, the best writing experience money can buy is the vintage *Parker 45*
  - I picked one up in near-mint condition for $11, don’t spend more than $20
- Use cartridges, don’t bother with ink bottles — you have better things to do with your life
### Normal pens
- Ballpoint: *Uniball Jetstream* ($20 pack of 12)
- Rollerball: *Pilot Precise V5/V7* ($15 pack of 12)
- Gel: you can’t really beat the humble and ubiquitous *Pilot G2* (in a drawer at your residence or workplace)
### Machined pens
- Not even once
### Headphones
- If you have a Mac, get the 80-ohm version of the *Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro* ($160 now, but can be found for under $100)
  - Macs have good enough internal DACs to drive these headphones
- If you don’t have a Mac then you will need an external DAC
  - Get something from *FiiO*, the *K3* is solid ($160)
  - If you get an external DAC then get the 256-ohm version of these headphones
### Mechanical pencils
- *Staedtler 925 35-05* with *Pentel Hi Polymer Super 0.5mm 2B* lead
- rOtring leverages nostalgia but their pencils are realistically too unbalanced and ungainly for comfortable use
### Printers
- Any black-and-white *Brother* laser printer
  - Out of all printers these have the least wireless issues but save yourself future pain and just use it wired
  - Not even AGI will be able to solve printer wireless networking

This list will be updated as more things come to mind.
