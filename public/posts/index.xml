      <title>Some poems I like</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/put-my-house&#34;&gt;this poem&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker and it made me despair somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In response, these are some of the poems I often find myself coming back to, reading aloud to myself, and writing out repeatedly as a means of procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-shropshire-lad-xl&#34;&gt;A Shropshire Lad, XL&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A.E. Housman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;Into my heart an air that kills&#xA;From yon far country blows:&#xA;What are those blue remembered hills,&#xA;What spires, what farms are those?&#xA;&#xA;That is the land of lost content,&#xA;I see it shining plain,&#xA;The happy highways where I went&#xA;And cannot come again.&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;moonlight-night&#34;&gt;Moonlight Night&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R.M.

      <title>Wellness as work ethic</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/wellness-work-ethic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay was originally published in Vol VI Issue 2 of the&lt;/em&gt; RUMS Review &lt;em&gt;magazine. You can read the full issue &lt;a href=&#34;https://online.fliphtml5.com/plvos/ywhu/#p=35&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Modern medicine has put health back into the hands of the individual. A slew of evidence over the past few decades has established exercise, mindful eating, and other such lifestyle interventions as necessities for the maintenance of good health. This evidence base has spawned public messaging campaigns, legislation such as the Soft Drinks Industry Levy and the proposed phased ban on cigarettes, and (perhaps most conspicuously) a 5-billion-dollar behemoth of a wellness industry. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The serotonin theory of depression: a post-mortem analysis</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/serotonin-theory-post-mortem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was written in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/Aryan_AroraA&#34;&gt;Aryan Arora&lt;/a&gt; and originally published in Vol XI Issue 1 of the&lt;/em&gt; RUMS Review &lt;em&gt;Magazine. The full issue is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://online.fliphtml5.com/plvos/ujxj/index.html#p=1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder, commonly referred to as depression, lies in the unfortunate realm of conditions which are simultaneously widespread, debilitating, stigmatised, and poorly understood. It is one of psychiatry’s paradigm-defining maladies; being the most common mental illness, it affects more than 264 million people globally and is the second leading cause of chronic disability worldwide. Its enigmatic nature has occupied minds both medical and artistic for millennia, from Hippocrates’ “humoral melancholia” to the “anomie” of the Romantics. Contemporary understandings emphasise a triad of symptoms: low mood, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure in normally pleasurable activities), and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatrist, heal thyself</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatrist-heal-thyself/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was left with some reflections (and doubts) after the psychiatry lectures I received over my first year in medical school. I have been putting off writing them up, but in the interest of populating this blog with&lt;/em&gt; something, &lt;em&gt;below lie some disorganised impressions on the topic. Take seriously at your own caution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word “biopsychosocial” comes up a lot in lectures, which is directionally good, but the supposedly equal treatment of these factors seems a bit nominal and epistemologically confused. The unspoken implication of a lot of this teaching is that the psyche is the substrate of neuroanatomy and neurochemistry, which is no doubt defensible, but nonetheless establishes a hierarchy in which the psychosocial component is secondary to the biological.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrating from Jekyll to Eleventy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/blog-migration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of September 2024, this blog runs on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I’m going to leave this up both because it stands as an appraisal of the merits of SSGs in general, and because it serves as a memento mori for the eternal and inescapable Dukkha of Optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N.B.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;If the term &amp;lsquo;Static Site Generator&amp;rsquo; is unfamiliar to you, I recommend reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html&#34;&gt;this blogpost&lt;/a&gt; as a primer. Blog like a hacker!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though it may look the same, the backend of this blog has been drastically simplified. Previously, I was using the static site generator &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to build this site, but I have now migrated to a newer, flashier, and much easier to use SSG called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.11ty.dev/&#34;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
